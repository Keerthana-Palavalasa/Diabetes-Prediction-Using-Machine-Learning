# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
It is a data science project in which we need to predict whether a given data point is diabetic or not. Since it comes under Classification technique which is a type of Supervised Machine Learning, I built the model using different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes , Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The model built with Support Vector Machine gave high accuracy out of all in predicting whether the given data point is diabetic or not.
